
In this project, I have written a Python Script to explore the data of three cities in USA. 
And I have calculated descriptive statistics data  with the help of user interface.


How to run the script:

You can run the script using a Python integrated development environment (IDE) such as Spyder. To install Spyder, you will need to download the Anaconda installer. This script is written in Python 3.6 , so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing Anaconda, you will find the Spyder IDE by opening Anaconda Navigator.


Datasets:
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 

         Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
         End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
         Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
         Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
         End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
         User Type (Subscriber/Customer)

        The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
        Gender
        Birth Year


Statistics Computed:

Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
           most common month
           most common day of week
           most common hour of day
 
Popular stations and trip:
           most common start station
           most common end station
           most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

Trip duration:
          total travel time
          average travel time

 User info:
          counts of each user type
          counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
          earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
